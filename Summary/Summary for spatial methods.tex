\section{Gaussian random field and its challenge}
Gaussian spatial processes has been popular for decades in spatial data contexts like geostatistics where they are known as kriging, and in computer experiments where they are deployed as surrogate models or emulators. More recently, they have become a popular prediction engine in the machine learning literature. The reasons are many, but the most important are probably that: the Gaussian structure affords a large degree of analytic capability not enjoyed by other general-purpose approaches to nonparametric nonlinear modeling; and because they perform well in out-of-sample tests.

Assume there is a response or dependent variable $Y(s)$ at a generic location $s \in \boldsymbol{D} \subset \mathcal{R}^2$ along with a $p \times 1$ vector of spatially referenced predictors $\boldsymbol{X}(s)$. A spatial regression model has the form
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
y(s) = \boldsymbol{\beta}\boldsymbol{X}(s) + w(s) + \epsilon(s)
\end{aligned} \label{model}
\end{equation}
where $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ is the vector of regression coefficients. The residual from the regression is decomposed into two independent parts: a spatial process, $w(s)$, modelling spatial association, and an independent process, $\epsilon(s)$, also known as the nugget effect, modelling measurement error.

The nugget effect $\epsilon(s)$ is often assumed to follow a normal distribution with variance $\tau^2$ for every location $s$.
The spatial process $w(s)$ in (\ref{model}) is often referred to as spatial random effects, capturing the effect of unmeasured or unobserved covariates with spatial pattern.

The most common specification for $w(s)$ is $w(s) \sim GP(0, \boldsymbol{C}(\cdot, \cdot))$, a zero-mean Gaussian process with a valid covariance function $\boldsymbol{C}(s, s^\prime)$. It is often reasonable to assume a constant process variance and thus we specify \
$\boldsymbol{C}(s, s^\prime) = \sigma^2 \rho (s, s^\prime; \boldsymbol{\theta})$, where $\rho (s, s^\prime; \boldsymbol{\theta})$ is a correlation function and $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ is a vector of correlation parameters which needs to be estimated from a finite number of observations, $\boldsymbol{Y} = \left(y(s_1). \cdots, y(s_n)\right)^\prime$.

Therefore, $y(s)$ follows a spatial Gaussian process, and thus we have the log-likelihood function for $(\boldsymbol{\beta}, \tau^2, \sigma^2, \boldsymbol{\theta}):$
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
l(\boldsymbol{\beta}, \tau^2, \sigma^2, \boldsymbol{\theta}) \propto  - \frac{1}{2}\log |\boldsymbol{\Sigma}| - \frac{1}{2}\left(\boldsymbol{Y} - \boldsymbol{\beta}\boldsymbol{X}\right)^\prime \boldsymbol{\Sigma}^{- 1}\left(\boldsymbol{Y} - \boldsymbol{\beta}\boldsymbol{X}\right)
\end{aligned} \label{loglik}
\end{equation}
where $\boldsymbol{\Sigma} = \boldsymbol{C} + \tau^2\boldsymbol{I}.$
Then best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) at an unobserved location $s_0$ can be obtained by the kriging
equation:
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\hat{y}(s_0) = \boldsymbol{\beta}\boldsymbol{X}(s_0) + \boldsymbol{c}_{s_0}^\prime\boldsymbol{\Sigma}^{- 1}\left(\boldsymbol{Y} - \boldsymbol{\beta}\boldsymbol{X}\right)
\end{aligned} \label{Kriging}
\end{equation}
where $\boldsymbol{c}_{s_0} = \left(\boldsymbol{C}(s_0, s_1), \dots, \boldsymbol{C}(s_0, s_n)\right)^\prime$.

However, with large or massive data, direct implementation of these statistical process, including parameter etimation by (\ref{loglik}) and interpolation by (\ref{Kriging}), becomes computationally prohibitive, since evaluating the log-likelihood in (\ref{loglik}) and solving the kriging equation (\ref{Kriging}) involve the Cholesky factorization of an $n \times n$ covariance matrix for data of size $n$, which requires $O(n^3)$ operations and $O(n^2)$ memory in general(see \href{https://chenyw68.github.io/Literature/[2012]Advances and Challenges in Space-time Modelling of Natural Events.pdf}{\cite{porcu2012advances}}, \href{https://chenyw68.github.io/Literature/[2012]A full scale approximation of covariance functions for large spatial data sets.pdf}{\cite{sang2012full}}, \href{https://chenyw68.github.io/Literature/[2018]A case study competition among methods for analyzing large spatial data.pdf}{\cite{heaton2019case}}, \href{https://chenyw68.github.io/Literature/[2020]A Fused Gaussian Process Model for Very Large Spatial Data.pdf}{\cite{ma2020fused}}).

\section{Several approaches to overcome the computational problem}
From an \textbf{approximation} point of view, the approximation of the likelihood in either the spatial or spectral domain is fundamental solution to overcome computational obstacles. These solutions focus on model development, the design of efficient and parallel algorithms, and the improvement and efficient use of modern computing platforms (e.g. Using \href{https://hpc.niasra.uow.edu.au/azm/Spatial_GPUs.html}{TensorFlow} and  \href{https://github.com/cdeterman/gpuR}{GPU}).

\subsection{Likelihood approximations in the spatial domain by low rank methods}
\textcolor[rgb]{1.00,0.00,1.00}{Comments:}
The reduced rank based methods usually fail to accurately capture the local, small scale dependence structure \href{https://chenyw68.github.io/Literature/[2012]A full scale approximation of covariance functions for large spatial data sets.pdf}{\citep{sang2012full}}. 
%The subsequent multiresolution (MR) methods (e.g. LatticeKrig, Multiresolution Approximations) compensates for this problem to some extent.
\subsubsection{\href{https://chenyw68.github.io/Literature/[2017]An R Package for Spatial and Spatio-Temporal Prediction with Large Datasets(FRK).pdf}{Fixed Rank Kriging}}
FRK (\href{https://chenyw68.github.io/Literature/[2006]Spatial prediction for massive datasets.pdf}{\citep{cressie2006spatial}}, \href{https://chenyw68.github.io/Literature/[2008]Fixed rank kriging for very large spatial data sets.pdf}{\citep{cressie2008fixed}}) aims to approximate the spatial process $w(s)$ in (\ref{model}) by a linear combination of $r$ ($<< n$) basis functions which ensures that all estimation and prediction equations only contain inverses of matrices of size $r \times r$.
\subsubsection{\href{https://chenyw68.github.io/Literature/[2015]spBayes for Large Spatio-Temporal Data Models.pdf}{Gaussian Predictive Processes} (\href{https://chenyw68.github.io/Literature/[2020]Bayesian spatially varying coefficient models in the spBayes R package.pdf}{GPP})}
With regard to the challenge of computational cost on covariance matrices, \href{https://chenyw68.github.io/Literature/[2008]Gaussian predictive process models for large spatial data sets.pdf}{\citet{banerjee2008gaussian}} proposed a class of models based on the idea of a spatial predictive process which is motivated by Kriging equation in (\ref{Kriging}). The predictive process projects the original process, $w(s)$ in (\ref{model}), onto a subspace generated by realizations of the original process at a specified set of locations (or knots). The approach is in the same spirit as process modeling approaches using basis functions and kernel convolutions, that is, specifications which attempt to facilitate computations through lower dimensional process representations.

\textcolor[rgb]{1.00,0.00,1.00}{Comments:}
\begin{itemize}
 \item [1)]One advertised advantage of using the GPP approach as opposed to \href{https://chenyw68.github.io/Literature/[2017]FRK_intro.pdf}{FRK} or \href{https://chenyw68.github.io/Literature/[2014]LatticeKrig A multi-resolution spatial model for large data.pdf}{LatticeKrig} is that the GPP basis functions are completely determined by the choice of covariance function $C(\cdot, \cdot)$, and note that the subsequent \href{https://chenyw68.github.io/Literature/[2017]A Multi-Resolution Approximation for Massive Spatial Datasets.pdf}{Multiresolution approximations} is in step with GPP in this regard.
\item [2)]At the same time, however, when $C(\cdot, \cdot)$ is governed by unknown parameters (which is nearly always the case) the GPP basis functions need to be calculated iteratively rather than once as in FRK or LatticeKrig which will subsequently increase computation time.

\textcolor[rgb]{1.00,0.00,1.00}{Comments:}
The covariance tapering has shown great computational gains, but it also has its own drawbacks. 
\begin{itemize}
 \item [1)]The covariance tapering may not be effective in accounting for \textbf{spatial dependence with long range}.
 \item [2)]The accuracy of the tapering approximation for \textbf{nonstationary problems} remains an open question, and the application of tapering techniques to \textbf{multivariate random fields} remains to be explored due to the lack of flexible compactly supported cross-covariance functions, see \href{https://chenyw68.github.io/Literature/[2012]Advances and Challenges in Space-time Modelling of Natural Events.pdf}{\citet{porcu2012advances}}.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Spatial Partitioning}
By dividing region $\boldsymbol{D}$ into $m$ disjoint subregions ($d = 1, 2, \cdots, m$),  and then the modeling approach based on spatial
partitioning is to again assume the model in (\ref{model2}) but take on the assumption of independence between observations across subregions. 
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\boldsymbol{y}_d = \boldsymbol{\beta}\boldsymbol{X}_d + \boldsymbol{H}_d\boldsymbol{w} + \boldsymbol{\xi}_d + \boldsymbol{\epsilon}_d
\end{aligned} \label{model2}
\end{equation}
where $\boldsymbol{H}_d$ is a matrix of spatial basis function for subregions $d$.

\textcolor[rgb]{1.00,0.00,1.00}{Comments:}
\begin{itemize}
 \item [1)] Notice that, in (\ref{model2}) each subregion shares common $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ and $\boldsymbol{w}$ parameters which allows smoothing across subregions in spite of the independence assumption. Further, the assumption of independence across subregions effectively creates a block-diagonal structure for $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}$ and allows the likelihood to be computed in parallel (with one node per subregion), thereby facilitating computation.
 \item [2)] The key to implementing the spatial partitioning approach is the choice of partition and the literature is replete with various options. 
  A priori methods to define the spatial
partitioning include partitioning the region into equal areas (\href{https://chenyw68.github.io/Literature/[2011]Covariance approximation for large multivariate spatial data sets.pdf}{\citep{sang2011covariance}}), partitioning based on centroid clustering (\href{https://chenyw68.github.io/Literature/[2005]Analyzing nonstationary spatial data using piecewise Gaussian processes.pdf}{\citep{kim2005analyzing}}), hierarchical clustering based on spatial gradients (\href{https://chenyw68.github.io/Literature/[2017]Nonstationary Gaussian Process Models Using Spatial Hierarchical Clustering from Finite Differences.pdf}{\citep{heaton2017nonstationary}}). Alternatively, model-based approaches to spatial partitioning include treed regression(\href{https://chenyw68.github.io/Literature/[2014]Adaptive Bayesian Nonstationary Modeling for Large Spatial Datasets Using Covariance Approximations.pdf}{\citep{konomi2014adaptive}}) and mixture modeling (\href{https://chenyw68.github.io/Literature/[2014]A multivariate spatial mixture model for areal data.pdf}{\citet{neelon2014multivariate}}), but these approaches typically require more computation.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Likelihood approximations in the spatial domain by sparse precision methods}
The sparse precision methods focus on basis function and conditional likelihood.

}{\citep{katzfuss2017parallel}} and  \href{https://chenyw68.github.io/Literature/[2017]A Multi-Resolution Approximation for Massive Spatial Datasets.pdf}{\citep{katzfuss2017multi}})
\subsubsection{SPDE/INLA}
\href{https://chenyw68.github.io/Literature/[2005]Gaussian markov random fields theory and applications.pdf}{\citet{rue2005gaussian}} rigorously suggest to approximate Gaussian random fields through Markov fields with a huge increase in speed for the simulations. \href{https://chenyw68.github.io/Literature/[2011]An explicit link between GF and GMRFs the SPDE approach.pdf}{\citep{lindgren2011explicit}} show the construction of the corresponding GMRFs can be used to represent the Matérn field on a triangulated lattice.

\textcolor[rgb]{1.00,0.00,1.00}{Comments:}
\begin{itemize}
 \item [1)]The numerical factorization of the precision matrix using sparse matrix algorithms can be done at a typical cost of $O(n^{3/2})$ for two-dimensional GMRFs.
 \item [2)]The drawback of this approachis that we can only find the explicit form of GMRFs for those Gaussian random fields that have a Matérn covariance structure at certain integer smoothnesses.  they can be extended to model Matérn covariances on the sphere, nonstationary locally isotropic Gaussian random fields, Gaussian random fields with oscillating correlation functions, and non-isotropic fields.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{NNGP}
The nearest neighbor Gaussian process (\href{https://chenyw68.github.io/Literature/[2016]Hierarchical nearest-neighbor Gaussian process models for large geostatistical datasets.pdf}{\cite{datta2016hierarchical}},
\href{https://chenyw68.github.io/Literature/[2019]Efficient algorithms for bayesian nearest neighbor gaussian processes.pdf}{\cite{finley2019efficient}}
) is defined from the conditional specification of the joint distribution of spatial process $w(s)$ in (\ref{model}), one forms of composite likelihoods which is motivated by Vecchia (1988) ideas.

Composite likelihoods which points out the difficulty in choosing conditioning sets and  evaluation of the approximation accuracy, but with the advent of the NNGP approach, the problem has been solved.
\textcolor[rgb]{1.00,0.00,1.00}{Comments:}
\begin{itemize}
 \item [1)] Total operations is $O((n + k)m^3)$ where $m (\approx 20)$ is the size of conditioning set or neighbor set, and $n$ and $k$ is sample size and reference set size.
 \item [2)] NNGP can be extended to large spatio-temporal data (
\href{https://chenyw68.github.io/Literature/[2016]Nonseparable dynamic NNGP models for large spatio-temporal data.pdf}{\cite{datta2016nonseparable}}) and non-stationary process(\href{https://chenyw68.github.io/Literature/[2020]Computationally efficient nonstationary nearest-neighborGaussian process models using data-driven techniques.pdf}{\cite{konomi2019computationally}}).

\textcolor[rgb]{1.00,0.00,1.00}{Comments:}
The spectral methods are computationally efficient by avoiding the calculation of determinants and can be easily adapted to model nonstationary processes as a mixture of independent stationary processes. [15] presented a version of Whittle’s approximation to the Gaussian
negative log-likelihood by introducing a lattice process which can be used to deal with irregularly spaced data. Additional computational savings were obtained by truncating the spectral representation of the lattice process. If $n$ is the total number of observations of the process $\boldsymbol{Y}$, m is lattice size, the calculation requires $O(m \log_2 m + n)$ operations rather than $O(n^3)$ for the exact likelihood of $\boldsymbol{Y}$.

However, they do not overcome the difficulty in prediction with massive data.
